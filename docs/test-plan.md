# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## The users can input their names.

The users can input their names as player 1 and 2 and the game will recognize this.

### Test Data To Use

This was selected as it is needed to identify the players and give them their own inputs for when it is their turn.

### Expected Test Result

The code should recognize player 1 and 2 with the names that they chose for the rest of the game. Should print their names when they input it into the code.

## Board input

The code should lay out a board that is easy to read that also follows the players inputs after each turn.

### Test Data To Use

This was chosen so that the players would have a board to play on that was easy to read.

### Expected Test Result

This should print out a board for the players to play on after they input their names.

## Player moves and Turns

The game should cycle the players turns and input their moves when made.

### Test Data To Use

I chose this so I can confirm that players would have turn after turn with it cycling.

### Expected Test Result

The game should pick up one players move then give the other player a chance to move.
